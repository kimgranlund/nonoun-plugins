## Goal
`dispatch.py advance` on a solo whose report or final line says `blocked` records it as blocked and prepares no verifier, instead of routing it as `solo L2 done`.

## Intent
- Do: reproduce first (a selftest case built from the observation below), then make the smallest fix in `plugins/sdlc-lite/scripts/dispatch.py` and its docs.
- Non-goals: the other rehearsal findings (each has its own ticket).
- Done when: the criteria pass.

## Context
Observed: T-0003's solo ended `solo blocked ...` (a plan defect in its criterion 2) and advance printed `solo L2 done` and prepared a verifier.

Evidence: the 0.36 release rehearsal 2026-10-24 (sdlc-lite 8f98f1f1, Claude Code 2.1.309, `fanout.py prep`/`land`/`settle` with `isolation: worktree` sub-agents) in the throwaway repo /Users/kimgranlund/Projects/nonoun/live036 (state kept); report /Users/kimgranlund/Projects/nonoun/live036-run/report.md, step log /Users/kimgranlund/Projects/nonoun/live036-run/log.md, the conductor transcript under ~/.claude/projects/-Users-kimgranlund-Projects-nonoun-live036/.

## Constraints
The failing test lands before or with the fix.

## Acceptance criteria
1. A `dispatch.py` selftest case: advance on a solo dispatch whose report says `blocked` prints blocked and prepares no verifier; with the change reverted it fails (state the FAIL line).
2. `python3 plugins/sdlc-lite/scripts/gate_lock.py run --need compute_units=1 --nice -- python3 plugins/sdlc-lite/scripts/dispatch.py selftest` exits 0, `check.py` exits 0, `check-packaging.py` passes, and `git diff --check <base sha>` exits 0.
