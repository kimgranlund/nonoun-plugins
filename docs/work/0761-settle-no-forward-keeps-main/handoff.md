## Goal
`fanout.py settle <integration>` without `--forward` never moves main, as the fanout skill documents (`--forward` is the flag that brings the integration branch into main); or the docs say exactly when plain settle moves main.

## Intent
- Do: reproduce first (a selftest case built from the observation below), then make the smallest fix in `plugins/sdlc-lite/scripts/fanout.py` and its docs.
- Non-goals: the other rehearsal findings (each has its own ticket).
- Done when: the criteria pass.

## Context
Observed: `settle fanout/rehearsal` (no --forward) printed `settled: fanout/rehearsal is in main`, and the reflog shows `26b7276 main@{0}: merge fanout/rehearsal: Fast-forward`. First reproduce and find whether this is intended (read `fanout.py settle` and the skill's settle text); state the finding in the Outcome.

Evidence: the 0.36 release rehearsal 2026-10-24 (sdlc-lite 8f98f1f1, Claude Code 2.1.309, `fanout.py prep`/`land`/`settle` with `isolation: worktree` sub-agents) in the throwaway repo /Users/kimgranlund/Projects/nonoun/live036 (state kept); report /Users/kimgranlund/Projects/nonoun/live036-run/report.md, step log /Users/kimgranlund/Projects/nonoun/live036-run/log.md, the conductor transcript under ~/.claude/projects/-Users-kimgranlund-Projects-nonoun-live036/.

## Constraints
The failing test lands before or with the fix.

## Acceptance criteria
1. A `fanout.py` selftest case pins the documented behavior of plain settle on main; with the change reverted it fails (state the FAIL line); if the behavior was intended, the case pins it and the skill text says so.
2. `python3 plugins/sdlc-lite/scripts/gate_lock.py run --need compute_units=1 --nice -- python3 plugins/sdlc-lite/scripts/fanout.py selftest` exits 0, `check.py` exits 0, `check-packaging.py` passes, and `git diff --check <base sha>` exits 0.
