## Goal
The solo brief for a host lane names one report path, inside the worktree, in both the `Report file:` line and the end line, so a solo never ends naming a path that does not exist.

## Intent
- Do: reproduce first (a selftest case built from the observation below), then make the smallest fix in `plugins/sdlc-lite/scripts/fanout.py` and its docs.
- Non-goals: the other rehearsal findings (each has its own ticket).
- Done when: the criteria pass.

## Context
Observed: the brief says `Report file: /Users/kimgranlund/Projects/nonoun/live036/.sdlc/runtime/tasks/add-sub/T-0001-solo.md` (main checkout) and later `write the report to .sdlc/runtime/tasks/add-sub/T-0001-solo.md under your worktree root`; T-0003 ended `solo blocked /Users/kimgranlund/Projects/nonoun/live036/.sdlc/runtime/tasks/add-div/T-0003-solo.md` and no file existed there.

Evidence: the 0.36 release rehearsal 2026-10-24 (sdlc-lite 8f98f1f1, Claude Code 2.1.309, `fanout.py prep`/`land`/`settle` with `isolation: worktree` sub-agents) in the throwaway repo /Users/kimgranlund/Projects/nonoun/live036 (state kept); report /Users/kimgranlund/Projects/nonoun/live036-run/report.md, step log /Users/kimgranlund/Projects/nonoun/live036-run/log.md, the conductor transcript under ~/.claude/projects/-Users-kimgranlund-Projects-nonoun-live036/.

## Constraints
The failing test lands before or with the fix.

## Acceptance criteria
1. A `fanout.py` selftest case: the host-lane brief's `Report file:` and end line name the same worktree-relative path and no main-checkout path; with the change reverted it fails (state the FAIL line).
2. `python3 plugins/sdlc-lite/scripts/gate_lock.py run --need compute_units=1 --nice -- python3 plugins/sdlc-lite/scripts/fanout.py selftest` exits 0, `check.py` exits 0, `check-packaging.py` passes, and `git diff --check <base sha>` exits 0.
